Hence we got accuracy on different classification

-logisitic regression got accuracy 46%

-DecisionTree got accuracy 58%

-Random Forest got accuracy 90%

we have done all the elementry EDA steps

After feature selection we used four machine learning models and achieved quite good accuracy 90% in Random Forest for predicting the credit card approval.
